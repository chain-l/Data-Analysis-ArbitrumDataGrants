# Dataset for Analyzing Voting Patterns in Arbitrum DAO Proposals

This repository contains the dataset used for analyzing the voting pattern with the timeline in mind. It was an effort to understand the voting across Day 1 - 7 on 143 Snapshot proposals the Arbitrum DAO members voted upon.

## Main Task Description

### Analysis of Delegates Voting Patterns in Arbitrum Proposals

The **"Analysis of Delegates Voting Patterns in Arbitrum Proposals"** project aims to investigate the voting behaviors of delegates within the Arbitrum governance framework. Through rigorous statistical analysis of a comprehensive dataset, we seek to uncover consistent patterns and correlations in delegate voting across various proposals. The approach prioritizes systematic methodology and thorough documentation, aiming to provide valuable insights into delegate participation and decision-making dynamics.

## Sub-Task Description

### Optimizing Voting Periods: An Analysis of Day-Wise Voting Patterns in Arbitrum Proposals

The sub-task **"Optimizing Voting Periods: An Analysis of Day-Wise Voting Patterns in Arbitrum Proposals"** investigates the feasibility of shortening voting periods from 7 to 6 days. By analyzing day-to-day vote counts and voting power, we aim to identify opportunities for optimization while ensuring effective decision-making. This involves examining trends in vote distribution, identifying influential voters, and assessing the impact of last-day voting. The goal is to provide insights to streamline governance processes within the Arbitrum DAO ecosystem.
